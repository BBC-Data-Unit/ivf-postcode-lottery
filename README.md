In July 2018 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-44884503) on varying availability of IVF treatment across the UK. As part of the story we made a heatmap in QGIS using ONS shapefiles and data from the campaign group Fertility Fairness showing how many cycles of IVF are provided by each clinical commissioning group area. The map shows a strong regional distribution.
